    <h3>Temple Snapshot</h3>
    <p>The 257-foot high Los Angeles California Temple looms over famous Santa Monica Boulevard in Westwood. The spacious grounds are filled with a dazzling array of foliage including—to name a few—Canary Island Pine trees, several varieties of palm trees, Bird of Paradise trees, olive trees, and rare Chinese Ginkgo trees. Two fountains, a large reflection pool, and several family-themed statues further beautify the grounds. North of the temple, is a public visitors' center that showcases a representation of Thorvaldsen's Christus statue and also houses the popular Los Angeles Family History Library. The temple grounds are all aglow at Christmastime when thousands of multi-colored lights decorate the numerous trees and features.</p>

    <h3>Temple Snapshot</h3>
    <p>When President Thomas S. Monson announced that a fifth temple for Arizona would be built in Phoenix, he stated: "The blessings of the temple are eternal. Those who come to this holy house will feel of God's love for His children and come to a greater understanding of their own divine origin and potential as His sons and daughters." The announcement came less than a month following the announcement that temples would be built in Gilbert, Arizona, and in Arizona's Gila Valley. All three temples would serve members belonging to the district of the Mesa Arizona Temple, which was attended by more patrons than any other temple outside of Utah.</p>
